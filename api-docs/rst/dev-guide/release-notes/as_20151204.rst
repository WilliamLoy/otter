API v1.0 release, December 08, 2015
-----------------------------------

What's new
~~~~~~~~~~

*  Added a new :ref:`converge endpoint <trigger-convergence>`. You can submit a
   **POST** request to this endpoint to trigger convergence. Kindly check
   :ref:`convergence <convergence>`.

*  Added the ``status`` and ``errors`` attributes in group state.

*  Implemented :ref:`pause <pause-group>` scaling group operation.

*  Implemented  :ref:`resume <resume-group>` scaling group operation. 

Behavioral changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* If an autoscaled server is removed from the load balancer manually, and that
  server is supposed to be included based on the scaling group configuration,
  Autoscale reverts the change and adds the server back to the configured cloud
  load balancer. Note that autoscale does not care if server is added to any
  other CLB. It only ensures that server is always there in configured CLB.

* When Autoscale attempts to add a server to a cloud load balancer that is
  missing or deleted, the scaling group status changes to ``ERROR``.
  In previous Autoscale releases, the server that couldn't be added was deleted.
  In the current release, the server remains in the scaling group instead of
  being deleted.
