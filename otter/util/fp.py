    'The wrapper combinator'

    Given f, any function, and g, a function which accepts a callable as its
    first argument, return a function:

        Î»(*args, **kwargs): g(f, *args, **kwargs)

    This allows g to "wrap" f, so that g is responsible for calling f. g must expect a
    callable as its first argument, of course.

    This is basically a way to do dependency injection -- if a function g
    wants to call f, instead of just referring to f directly, it can accept
    it as a parameter.
